<h2>Employee Detail</h2>
<!-- here we are trying to access the employees object outside the class it is declare -->
<!-- so we cannot access the employees object unless we create a copy of employees object inside the class of this component -->
<!-- does this approach works ? -->
<!-- yes it does -->
<!-- but is this approach correct? -->
<!-- No, not at all -->
<!-- we need to use services here -->
<ul *ngFor="let emp of employees">
    <li>{{emp.id}}. {{emp.name}} - {{emp.age}}</li>
</ul>
